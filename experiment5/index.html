				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p> This project is basically a giant stadium, packed with a crowd that’s made out of tons of colored
					spheres. I wanted to get that feeling of a real game where everyone is waving their flags and the
					stands are completely full. The crowd is just a bunch of circles, but if you look at it all
					together, it kind of feels alive. The colors are inspired by Barcelona stadium tifo pics, so it’s
					mostly red, yellow, and blue everywhere.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The stadium bowl is made with an ellipse shape, and then I
					fill it up with a ton of spheres that are randomly placed but still follow the shape of the stands.
					Each one gets a color based on a simple palette. The background is a gradient that shifts a bit to
					look like the sky, and there's a field at the bottom that's just a green rectangle. The hardest part
					was making the crowd dense without overlapping the field or going outside the bowl.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This one took a lot of attempts to get right. Lining up all the spheres so they actually fit into a
					stadium shape instead of just a random blob was way trickier than I expected. There were a bunch of
					times where the crowd just looked off or the colors didn’t really feel right together. Trying to get
					the generation to look a little random but not totally chaotic took a lot of trial and error too.
					Even with all the challenges, finally getting it to look like a packed stadium felt pretty
					rewarding.
