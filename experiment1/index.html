				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>For this project the topic I want to talk about is why FC Barcelona is the best football club in the world. 
					It will include stuff like the first sextuple in history, the way we play football and have revolutionized how football is played multiple times, 
					our great players Messi, Neymar, Johan Cryfuff, Pedri, and La Massia, the best football academy in the world.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>It wasnt that hard to implement due to us having a good template and very detailed slides on what to do (thank you).
					The bulk of hte work was creating new content tags, filling those in and creating a cohernt prompt that worked with all of them.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was my first time working with a generator so it was really cool to start slow and with somehting not to complicated.
					I feel that I learned a good amount about how to modify a generator and see how it works.
