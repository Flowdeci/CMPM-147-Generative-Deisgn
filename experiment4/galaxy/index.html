				<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
				<p>This project explores the idea of Infinity by creating a universe that extends infinitely in all
					directions. The infinite expanse is represented by a seamless grid of tiles filled with stars,
					planets, and celestial features that generate dynamically based on their position, providing a
					continuous experience without boundaries.

					Variation in Space is achieved through the distinct appearance of stars, planets, and tiles, which
					change based on their location in the grid. Each region offers unique celestial arrangements, planet
					textures, and patterns, creating visual differences that reward exploration both while stationary
					and when navigating through the world.

					Variation in Key allows users to generate entirely new universes by entering different keys. Each
					key controls the noise seeds and random values that determine the placement and features of tiles,
					planets, and stars. Re-entering a previous key restores the exact same world, demonstrating the
					key's influence over the generator's structure.

					Signs of Life are introduced through interactive UFOs that appear when clicked. These UFOs move in
					random directions and disappear after 20 seconds, creating dynamic activity within the world.
					Additionally, the planets feature animated wavy lines and crater-like textures, ensuring the
					universe responds to both user input and the passage of time, making it feel alive and
					ever-changing.</p>

				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project is a galaxy generator. It generates a galaxy with stars and planets.
					The planets shapes and colors are genereated randomly, while the stars slowly change color.
					The user can also spawn in a ufo by clicking that will move in a random direction!
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>It took a long time to get the planets to appear in their correct spot and eventaually I was able to
					find how to get the current transtlation of a tile/anywhere and use
					that to push into my planet array and then use that to draw the planets in the correct spot. I also
					had to figure out how to get the stars to change color and how to get the ufo to move in a random
					direction.
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This project looks way bettter than my 1st project, but was way more challeneing. Making an infiinte
					world is really hard because you have to keep
					eveyrthing relative to the current camera positon and cant just draw all the planents that should eb
					there at once but rather which ones should be on screen. </p>
