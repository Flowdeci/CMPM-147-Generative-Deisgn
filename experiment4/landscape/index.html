				<h2>Aritst Statement</h2>
				<p>
					This project explores the idea of Infinity by creating a world that extends infinitely in all
					directions. The infinite terrain is represented by a grid of tiles that can be navigated endlessly,
					providing a seamless and boundless experience. Each tile dynamically generates features like grass,
					water, and sand based on its position, reinforcing the concept of an ever-expanding world.

					Variation in Space is achieved through the distinct appearance of tiles, which change based on their
					location in the grid. Grass, water, and sand regions transition naturally, with additional details
					like trees, fish, or cacti appearing in appropriate areas. This variation makes each region feel
					unique and visually interesting, whether the camera is stationary or moving.

					Variation in Key allows users to generate entirely new worlds by entering different keys. Each key
					determines the seed for the random and noise functions, controlling the placement and type of
					features like terrain, trees, and water. By re-entering a previous key, users can restore a specific
					world, highlighting how the key influences the generator's structure and appearance.

					Signs of Life are introduced through the interaction between the audience and the world. Clicking on
					tiles with grass causes flowers to grow dynamically, with their size, color, and placement
					determined by the seed and user input. These flowers persist and grow over time, adding an
					interactive layer that makes the world feel alive and responsive to user actions.

				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project is a landscape generator. It generates a landscape with trees and bodies of water.
					The terrian is genreated randommly using noise which helps to bridge the gaps between water and land
					with sand between the two noise values of both.
					All the decrations are genrated randomly too, but the user can click on any grass tiles to genrate
					leaves.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Noise was a big part of this project as it allowed me to create seamless terrian that appears to be randomly genearted. 
					Detemrieng the spots of tress, fish, and catucs was familiar at this point, and same with the water color gradient which I already
					did in my last projects.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This is my favotite project even though it runs kinda slow. I love the terrian geneation using noise and all the dectaotions really bring life to this project.
					I wish I oculdve done more decratiorsn but its alreayd running slow and I dont want to make it worse.
