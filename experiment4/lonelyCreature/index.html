				<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
				<p>This project explores the idea of Infinity by creating a world that extends infinitely in all
					directions. The infinite terrain is represented by a grid of tiles that can be navigated endlessly,
					providing a continuous experience without boundaries. Each tile dynamically generates based on its
					position, reinforcing the concept of an ever-expanding space.

					Variation in Space is achieved through the distinct appearance of tiles, which change based on their
					location in the grid. The tiles exhibit unique patterns and brightness levels, creating visual
					interest both when remaining stationary and while scrolling through different regions of the world.
					This variation makes each area feel distinct and alive.

					Variation in Key allows players to generate entirely new worlds by entering different keys. Each key
					controls the seed for the random and noise functions, ensuring that the appearance and behavior of
					the tiles change in a meaningful way. By re-entering a previous key, the world can be restored,
					showing how the key influences the underlying structure of the generator.

					Signs of Life are introduced through the interaction between creatures, enemies, and the passage of
					time. Creatures move autonomously, responding to the grid and interacting with enemies, which can
					transform into new creatures upon collision. Audience clicks also influence the grid, adding an
					interactive layer that makes the world feel dynamic and responsive rather than static.</p>

				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this project there is one lonely creature. They are all alone.
					But as time moves on unknown to them, they are not alone. They are surrounded by other creatures.
					They just arent friends yet. As the creature moves around the world and meets those other
					creatueres,
					they become friends and become creatures too. The user can help the creature meet these other
					friends by making
					paths to them by changing the different tiles. The creature can only move on light tiles while the
					unkowns can move on any tile.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Using the tile layout the creature can mvoe between tiles that are only accesbile to them. A tile is
					black or white
					depeneding on its hash and wether or not its been clicked yet. THe user can change between the two
					allowing them to somewhat control
					the creautres unpreditabe movenets. The other creatures are not limited and can move on any tile,
					but they move faster so it will be hard to make
					friends.
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This waas my first project so I started simple and tried to get an understanding of how the tiels
					worked along with the seeds.
					I didnt go for anyting to crazy but it was a fun nonethelesss to work on. I wish I was able to
					decrotate the map more but I couldnt decided on what to do that
					would make it better while still being able to finsih my other projects.
