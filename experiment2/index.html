				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>For this project I was trying to recreate the iconic FCB stadium, with varitions based on a random seed wihtout losing the oringal idea.
					 </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>To acomplish my goals I used the randomSeed(seed) funciton in almost all my functions that drew something to the screen so that they would always change based on the seed.
					But I also limited the range of the random function to make sure that the changes were not too drastic and that the final result was still recognizable as the Camp Nou.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This project was fun to work on and it was cool trying to make a gernaetor that remsbeled the orignal idea but still had enough varation. 
					The orignal image I chose did have a lot more detials that I thought would be easier to add but couldnt get them working but Im still pleased with the final resutl.
