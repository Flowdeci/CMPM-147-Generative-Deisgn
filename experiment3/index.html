				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project generates a pixel art oveowlrd and dungeon setting.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>By using a randomSeed the project first creates 2d array of characters that each represetn a tile.
					Then the project uses custom functions to alter that grid with different arrangments of characters to 
					create dungeon rooms and overworld biomis. Finally all the tiles are draw to the screen and which tile drawn
					is dictated by an autotilling function which can be used to create a more realistic look.</p>
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This project was super fun to work on becasue it applies a lot ot my major, CSGD and creating auto generated 
					worlds can be a big part of game design, so it was nice to see how the process works. autotilling was also a
					super fun process to work on and I think it really added to the overall look of the project and is smth that I could
					see myself using in the future. I also think that the project could be improved by adding a more comlpex tileset cuase i had to
					put multiple tiles togethere to get some of the correct autoititing rules.
